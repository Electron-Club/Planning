Proposed running order:

* [Introduction](./1. Introduction.md) - marto
* [Installation demo](./10. Installation.md) (that way the next couple of steps make sense to people)
* The Linux Front-end
* The Linux Back-end
* Q&A - everyone pitch in :)
* [Kit](./99. Kit.md), who is bringing what on the day (Please add what you're bringing)
