# The Electron Club

The Electron Club is a voluntary run space where people interested in things like Free Open Source Software, DIY culture, circuit bending, hardware hacking, streaming, audio and video editing, green technologies, and amateur radio can meet, use equipment, and share and disseminate their skills and ideas.

We encourage an attitude towards technology, media and DIY production that recognises the relation of these to society and the environment. The Electron Club welcomes debate and the development of practices that question and explore existing and new ways of working and understanding these.

The space also provides a location that not-for-profit community and discussion groups can use at no charge for meetings and to develop projects.

All are welcome.
